This document is intended for Adhoc developers and users.

We adhere to the [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format

## [0.0.5]
### Changed
- `Pivotable` opens a filter-helper when double-cliking a cell of the grid.
- `Pivotable` search now highlights/marks matching elements.


### Added
- Enable `customMarkerMetadata` in `AdhocSchema`
- Enable `tags` measure filtering in `Pivotable`
- Introduces `AdhocAutoConfiguration` for easy Spring auto-configuration.

## [0.0.4]
### Changed
- `IQueryOption` is now part of `IAdhocQuery`
- `debug` and `explain` are now only togglable as `IQueryOption`
- Normalize the way columns are parsed into SQL names (by relying on JooQ `Parser.parseName`).
- Improve `.getColumns` relatively to various column customizations (e.g. customType, calculatedColumn, etc)
- Improve `EXPLAIN` by reporting the queried cube, the queryId and its parentQueryId.

### Added
- Enable complex filtering, by additional groupBy from table and manual post-filtering (e.g. `JooqTableQueryFactory.ConditionWithFilter`)
- Enable `CalculatedColumn` which can evaluate additional columns based on table columns.
- Introduce `IImplicitOptions` in `DefaultQueryPreparator`
- Initial work around `CONCURRENT` option.

## [0.0.3]
### Added
- `ForestAsGraphvizDag`: can turn an `IMeasureForest` into a Graphviz DOT file.
- `ICubeWrapper.getCoordinates` can query multiple columns in one call, which is leveraged by `DuckDb` tables.
- `Pivotable` can now drop column/measure from grid headers.
- Fix serialization of `IQueryOptions`, and update `Pivotable` for proper options.

## [0.0.2]
### Added

This document is intended for Adhoc developers and users.

We adhere to the [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format

## [0.0.12]

### Added
- Introduced `InternalQueryOptions.ONE_TABLE_QUERY_PER_AGGREGATOR` to force `TableQueryOptimizerSinglePerAggregator` from the options.
- Enable custom `ISliceFilter` in `FILTER` in `TableQueryV2`
- `AndFilter.copyOf` and `OrFilter.copyOf` enables very fast creation of `AndFilter` and `OrFilter` is all optimizations ahs to be skipped.

### Changed
- Renamed `ITabularGroupByRecord.groupByKeySet()` into `ITabularGroupByRecord.columnsKeySet()`.

### Removed
- Removed `IAdhocSlice.getRawSliced(String)`. Prefer `IAdhocSlice.getGroupBy(String)`.

### Fixed
- Fix bug in SQL condition with NOT given NULL. (Typically `NOT(c = 'v')` is turned into `NOT(c IS NOT NULL AND c = 'v')`).
- Actuator configuration in Pivotable has been reviewed. `/actuator/info` and `/actuator/health` are public.
- Memory-leak in `CachingOperatorsFactory` due to `DispatchorQueryStep` adding values as option, for `CumulatingDecomposition`.
- Improve compaction in `IMultitypeMergeableGrid.closeColumn`

### Improved
- `FilterHelpers.getFilteredColumns` is faster by relying on `Stream.mapMulti`

## [0.0.11]

### Added
- Introduced `ISliceReader` to help reading coordinate given a `ISliceWithStep`. Usage is `slice.sliceReader().getValueMatcher(c)` instead of `FilterHelpers.getValueMatcher(slice.asFilter(), c)`.
- Introduced `FilterBuilder` to help building `ISliceFilter` with an explicit way to skip or not optimizations. It replaces `AndFilter.and` and `OrFilter.or` .
- Introduced `AdhocUnsafe.sliceFilterOptimizer` and `IFilterOptimizerHelpers` to enable customization of `ISliceFilter` optimizer.
- Enabled `ISliceFilter` over an `ICalculatedColumn`. It works by post-filtering after adding in groupBy underlying columns.
- Introduced `FilterEquivalencyHelpers` to help evaluating equivalent `ISliceFilter`. It is useful to workaround issues related to `ISliceFilter` optimizations, which leads to equivalent boolean expression having different representations.
- Introduced `FilterOptimizerHelpersWithCache.java`, to enable caching of intermediate `ISliceFilter`.
- Introduced `JooqTableWrapper.fieldsCache` to prevent fetching all columns on each query (especially on `CompositeCube` scenario).
- Introduced `IFilterStripper` to enable customization and cache-friendly behavior around `stripWhereFromFilter` and `isStricterThan` methods.

### Changed
- `ITableQueryEngine` is now a field of `CubeQueryEngine` (instead of `.makeTableQueryEngine` factory method).
- `OrFilter.or` now relies on `AndFilter.and` to apply the same set of optimizations.
- `CompositeCubesTableWrapper` now rejects queries referring to unknown columns (in `groupBy` or `filter`).
- `CompositeCubesTableWrapper` now apply filters on unknown column in subCube as if the whole subCube has the `onMissingColumn` value.
- `ITableTranscoder` is renamed into `ITableAliaser`. Relates classes are also renamed (`MapTableTranscoder -> MapTableAliaser`, etc).
- `MapTableAliaser.queriedToUnderlying(...)` is renamed `MapTableAliaser.aliasToOriginal(...)`.
- Update `DuckDB` to `1.4.0.0` (from `1.3.2.0`).
- `AndFilterBuilder.filter` is renamed `AndFilterBuilder.and`.
- `OrFilterBuilder.filter` is renamed `OrFilterBuilder.and`.
- `TableQueryOptimizerSinglePerAggregator` now rely on `TableQueryOptimizer` to evaluate rootInducers.
- `ColumnFilter.isEqualTo` is renamed `ColumnFilter.matchEq`.

### Fixed
- Prevent `AdhocFactories` using an invalid `ICoordinateNormalizer` by default, using `StandardSliceFactory` own default.
- Prefer `array.concat(otherArray)` over `arrat.push(...otherArray)` to improve performance and prevent `max call stack size` (https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/13826).
- `TableQueryEngineBootstrapped` will properly skip steps available from `IQueryStepCache`.
- Alternative `ITableQueryOptimizer` like `TableQueryOptimizerSinglePerAggregator` were broken due to lack of flexibility in sanity checks.

## [0.0.10]

### Added
- Introduced `ISliceFactory` to enable custom way of creating `Map` and `IAdhocSlice`.
- Introduced `ICoordinateNormalizer` to centralize how coordinates should be normalized (e.g. `int` into `long`).
- Introduced `NullMatcher.NULL_HOLDER` to represent `null` where a null-reference is forbidden.
- Introduced `ICalculatedCoordinate` to enable adding coordinate into columns. Typical usecase is having an `*` coordinate aggregating all other coordinates, as a grandTotal of current column.
- Playwright is activated to integration-tests Pivotable.

### Changed
- Update `DuckDB` to `1.3.2.0` (from `1.3.1.0`)
- `ITabularRecord.getGroupBys()` now returns a `IAdhocMap`
- Most `SliceAsMap` usages are replaced by `IAdhocSlice`, and `IAdhocSliceWithStep` does not extends `IAdhocSlice` anymore.
- `IAdhocFilter.MATCH_ALL` is now serialized as `"matchAll"`
- `IAdhocFilter.matchAll` is now serialized as `"matchNone"`
- `IAdhocFilter` is renamed `ISliceFilter`

### Fixed
- Various mis-behaviours related to `null` as `GROUP BY` coordinate.

- Introduces `CumulatingDecomposition`, which is another case of `Dispatchor`. Can be used for cumulative `SUM` through time.
- Introduces `JooqTableQueryFactory.canFilterAggregates`, to generate `SUM(CASE y THEN x)` instead of `SUM(x) FILTER (y)`, as many Databases (like `RedShift` does not support `FILTER`).
- Introduced `JooqTableCapabilities` to configure the SQL capabilities on the underlying table.

### Changed
- `IColumnMatcher.toString()` has specialized implementations, depending on the matcher type (e.g. `c==v` for `EqualsMatcher`).

- `AdhocUnsafe.defaultCapacity()` is renamed `AdhocUnsage.defaultColumnCapacity()`
- `AtotiMeasureToAdhoc` now supports non-`String` properties.
- `MultitypeHashColumn.purgeAggregationCarriers()` now returns a purged copy, instead of mutating current instance.
- `InMatcher` and `ComapringMatcher` now normalize `long-like` into `long` and `double-like` into `double`.
- `AdhocPrimitiveHelpers.isLongLike` over `BigDecimal` should never returns true. `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` are manage separately.

### Fixed
- `JooqTableQueryFactory` now supports `OrMatcher`, `AndMatcher` and `NotMatcher`.
- `ReversePolishCombination` now supports complex objects are subFormula results. More generally, subFormula results are are `.toString()` anymore.

- `ExecutingQueryContext ` is renamed `QueryPod`
- Improved `JooqSnowflakeSchemaBuilder` to better handle edge cases like fields with a `.` in their name.

- Rename `-Dadhoc.limitColumnLength=1024` into `-Dadhoc.limitColumnSize=1024`

### Fixed
- `TopologicalOrderSpliterator` is not `parallel` by default, as it should be triggered by `StandardQueryOptions.CONCURRENT`.
